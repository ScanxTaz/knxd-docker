This is a portage of KNXD into a container, working with Docker-compose in privileged mode (for USB support)

Please clone the repo and run

# docker-compose up -d

it will create a container named knxd_knxd_1 and load all dependencies to make it running properly.

Thanks to Smurfix for his amazing work.
